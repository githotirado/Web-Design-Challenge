Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

Weather data web site containing seven HTML pages.  A browser width of 1150+ pixels will produce one layout while a browser using a width of less than 1150 pixels will see a reduced layout per page.

# index.html: 
the landing page explaining the weather data collection from OpenWeatherMap API across cities all over the globe.

# temp.html, humidity.html, cloudy.html, wind.html:
Four category pages showing whether the geographic latitude of a city has an influence on the temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.

# data.html:
A table page containing all the data points collected showing the cities polled and their corresponding data points.

# comparison.html:
A main page displaying all 4 plots of latitude vs the weather pattern.

Navigation is activated, with top navigation bar to click between pages and the home page.  Sizing of the browser produced different layouts: browser windows greater than 1150 pixels in width produce one layout while browser windows less than 1150 produce another layout.
